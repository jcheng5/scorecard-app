# Shiny demo app: College Scorecard

This app is an example of Shiny's [HTML templates](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/templates.html) feature. It uses R and Shiny to present interesting information from the [College Scorecard Data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) and is styled based on the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/).
